JavaScript was an interesting language to start getting involved with and learning, so I wanted to do a project that would give me plenty of opportunities to gain further understandings of what JS is capable of and how to use it efficiently.

## Rationale

This project is designed to help further my understanding of JavaScript as a language, trying to lightly incorporate different functionalities to try and pull together a seamless experience for the user. 

Having the different kinds of story 'cards' as I've referred to them throughout the code, and having them pulled with a degree of randomness was important for me to understand how to implement, as it solved the first user story easily. If the cards being displayed to the user are random, then this will create a different user experience. 

However, I aim for this game to be developed by me the more I learn and the more ideas for cards I have, so I needed to create a system that easily allowed for later additions. 

I aim for this to also not involve AI art at some point. Gemini has been very useful in helping me create the art for the game currently, however I view these as placeholders to give the site some flavour while I wait to get some actual art drawn up and included.



## User Stories

- "I like to play games, and what the option to have a different experience each time I play."

- "I don't play many games, so want an easy to understand game that doesn't require many rules to get into."

- "I like to have varying difficulties when I play games, so I can feel like i'm getting better at it."
